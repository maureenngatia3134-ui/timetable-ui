## School Master Clsss 2024/2025
# Description
This project is a digital version of the Master Timetable for the 2024/2025 academic year. It was created to make the printed timetable easier to read, share, and access digitally. The timetable organizes lessons, breaks, lunch, and activities for Year 7 to Year 11 across Monday to Friday.

## Purpose and Content
The purpose of the project is to present the timetable in a clear and structured format using HTML and CSS. It includes all subjects, teacher codes, and activities exactly as they appear in the original printed version. The content is arranged into days, time slots, and year groups with merged cells for shared sessions such as Form Tutorâ€™s Time, Break, Lunch, Clubs, Games, and Debate.

## Implementation Approach
The timetable is implemented using HTML <table> with <thead> for time slot headers and <tbody> for the timetable content. Table cells are merged using rowspan and colspan where necessary. CSS is used to center the table, ensure consistent borders, add padding, and highlight special sessions like breaks and lunch for better readability. Accessibility is considered by using semantic HTML with table headers (<th>) for screen readers.

# File Structure
The project folder contains:
index.html: The main file with the timetable layout.
style.css: The stylesheet for formatting and highlights.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
timetable_preview.png: A screenshot of the timetable for quick preview.

## How to View or Use
To view the timetable, open the index.html file in any web browser. The table will display the full weekly schedule. Subjects, teacher codes, or sessions can be edited directly inside the HTML file if updates are needed.
