# School Master Clsss 2024/2025
## Description

This project is an online version of the Master Timetable for 2024/2025. It was made to make the paper timetable easier to read, share, and use on a computer. It shows lessons, breaks, lunch, and activities for Year 7 to Year 11 from Monday to Friday.

## Purpose and Content
The project’s purpose is to show the school timetable in a neat and clear way using HTML and CSS. It has all the subjects, teacher codes, and activities just like the printed timetable. The timetable is set out by days, time slots, and year groups, with some cells joined together for shared times like Form Tutor’s Time, Break, Lunch, Clubs, Games, and Debate.

## Implementation Approach
The timetable is implemented using HTML <table> with <thead> for time slot headers and <tbody> for the timetable content. Table cells are merged using rowspan and colspan where necessary. CSS is used to center the table, ensure consistent borders, add padding, and highlight special sessions like breaks and lunch for better readability. Accessibility is considered by using semantic HTML with table headers (<th>) for screen readers.

## File Structure
The project folder contains:
index.html: The main file with the timetable layout.
style.css: The stylesheet for formatting and highlights.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
timetable_preview.png: A screenshot of the timetable for quick preview.

## How to View or Use
To view the timetable, open the index.html file in any web browser. The table will display the full weekly schedule. Subjects, teacher codes, or sessions can be edited directly inside the HTML file if updates are needed.
